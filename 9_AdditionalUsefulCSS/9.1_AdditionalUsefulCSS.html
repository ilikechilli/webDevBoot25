  <h1>Additional Usefull CSS</h1>
  <p>This section will deal with some additional useful CSS properties. The most important of which are bolded in the list below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Transitions</b></li>
    <li><b>Position Property</b></li>
    <li>Opacity and Alphy channel</li>
    <li>Google Fonts</li>
    <li>Additional Background properties</li>
    <li>Transforms</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Opacity and Alpha channel</h2>
  <h3>Alpha</h3>
  <p>Alpha channel is an addition to regular RGB colors and adds Alpha to the color which is transparancy.</p>
  <p>Consider the example below where there is a div with a magenta background color. That div is populated by three other divs that have a white background color but with varying settings of transparancy or "Alpha" The top left inner square has an alpha setting is 1 (or 100%) and is not transparant at all, the top right square that has its transparancy set to 0.7 (or 70) and lets some of the background color of the parent div through and the lower left square has it set to 0.3 and lets much more of the magenta through:
  </p>
  <div id="alphaContainer">
    <div class="alphaDemo" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1);"></div>
    <div class="alphaDemo" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);"></div>
    <div class="alphaDemo" style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3);"></div>
  </div>

  <h3>Opcity</h3>
  <p>Opacity controls the opacity of an element but also of all its descendents. So if the element should include text, both the background color of the element and the text will be made (partly) transparant</p>

  <h2>Position</h2>
  <p>Position is confusing CSS property at first glance. It is very userfull nonetheless. It sets how an element is positioned in a document. It is the "top", "right", "left" and "bottom" properties which determine the final position of an element.</p>
  <p>The five settings for position are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>static (default): The Elements is positioned according to the normal flow of the document</li>
    <li>relative: the element is positioned relative to itself after following the normal flow of the document. This one is a bit tricky but is well demonstrated on MDN</li>
    <li>Absolute: The element is removed from the normal flow and is then positioned relative to its closest ancestor. Also tricky sometimes!</li>
    <li>fixed: The element is removed from the normal flow and is positioned relative to the viewport</li>
    <li>Sticky: The element is removed from the normal flow and is positioned relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is difficult to demonstrate all the positions with elements because for some it would hinder the view of the overall page so please refer to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position">the MDN reference on "position"</a> for a great demo.</p>
  <p>Update: I've attempted to create a demo for position <a href="./positionDemo.html">here</a></p>
  <p>One more important point is that an absolute positioned element can be positioned within its parent container if that container is set to relative positioning first!</p>

  <h2>CSS transitions</h2>
  <p>This allows us to animate the transition between one property value to another.</p>
  <p>Let's demonstrate transitions with an example. Hover over the green square below:</p>
  <div class="circleDiv"></div>
  <p>CSS transitions allow us to create some simple but beautifull animations very easily. Specify the transition for the element and then use a psuedoclass to change the element style. In the example above we styled the element to have a width and a hight of 2OO pixels and to be green we also give it the property "transition" and assign it 3 seconds. Then we add the pseudoclass :hover to the selector later and within that selector we add a border radius and change to color to red. Instead of immediately jumping from one style to the other when hovering over the element, it changes gradually between the two in the time set (3seconds). This is a very easy demonstration of transitions. Refer to MDN docs for more information on  </p>

  <h2>CSS Transforms</h2>
  <p>Transforming allows us to rotate, scale, move elements and much more.</p>
  <p>See the Demo <a href="transformDemo.html">here</a></p>

  <h2>There is more to Background</h2>
  <h3>Background image</h3>
  <p>Rather than use a background color, developers can also use background images using the "background-image" property and a URL to refer to the image that you want to use.</p>
  <h3>Background size</h3>
  <p>Contain, cover or repeat a background image. You can also specify how an image should repeat.</p>
  <h3>Background position</h3>
  <p>This determines where a background image is aligned.</p>
  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>There is a general shorthand property for background that can set color or image and the alignment and size all in one go.</p>

  <h2>Google Fonts and how to use them</h2>
  <p>Google fonts offers a great way to implement a wide variety of fonts in your document</p>
  <p>Even if the fonts are not included on the users machine, it can be included as a file or can be references from Google fonts.</p>
  <p>Navigate to google fonts and select the font(s) that you want to use. Select "embed" to view the code snippet needed to include the code into your project. The snippet should be included in the head of the page.</p>
