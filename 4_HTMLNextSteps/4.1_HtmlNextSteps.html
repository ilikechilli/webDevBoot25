  <h1>Next steps in HTML and semantics</h1>
  <h2>Inline versus block elements</h2>
  <p>Inline elements will not require their own line and can be placed 'in line' with other elements on the page</p>
  <p>Block elements will populate their own new line.</p>
  <p>Whether an element is inline or block is predetermined and each element will be one of those two but this can be changed using CSS</p>

  <h2>Div elements: The content division element</h2>
  <p>This is a generic container to hold things and group things together. A div is a block style element.</p>
