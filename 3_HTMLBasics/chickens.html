  <h1>This is an h1 header (use this only once!)</h1>
  <h2>This is an h2 header (Use this when required)</h2>
  <h6>This is an h6 header and this is the smallers header</h6>
  <h2>Paragraphs, bold, italics, line breaks and underlines</h2>
  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  <p>This is another paragraph. Whenever a new paragraph is created, it gets a new line</p>
  <p>Paragraphs, like other html elements can wrap around other elements like <b>This bold face</b> element which makes the text look thicker (bold)</p>
  <p>Words can also be made to look <em>italicized</em> or even combined <b><em>bold and italicized</em></b></p>
  <br>
  <p>An empty paragraph could in theory be used to add extra line breaks but there is a special tag that does this called the br tag which was used above this paragraph. Notice how it added more space.</p>
  <p>Finally, you may choose to use and underline (u) tag <u>like this</u></p>
  <p>A horizontal rule (hr) tag can be used to visually separate major section like the one shown below</p>
  <hr>

  <h2>Lists in HTML</h2>
  <h3>Ordered lists</h3>
  <p>Ordered lists are numbered lists and have a specific order to them you can create ordered lists using the "ol" tag and you can populate it with list items using the "li" tag</p>
  <ol>
    <li>First item in ordered list</li>
    <li>Second item in ordered list</li>
    <li>Third item...</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Unordered lists</h3>
  <p>Alternatively to ordered lists there are also unordered lists (ul) that list items (li) in a non specific order</p>
  <ul>
    <li>bulleted item</li>
    <li>in no particular</li>
    <li>order</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Anchor Tags</h3>
<p>Anchor tags kinda build the web. The are used to create hyperlinks to other web pages <br> 
They introduce a new concept called tag parameters, these are not added between the opening and closing tags but within the opening tag itself and allow programmers to add attributes to tags <br> The anchor tag needs an 'href' attribute with a link to work properly, otherwise it won't do anything. <a href="https://www.google.com/">Clicking this line will take you to google!</a></p>
<p>Anchor tags can also be used to navigate to another page within your own project! So you don't need to provide a WWW link but you will need to link to the page in your folder. Clicking the link below will take you to a page that is not on the World wide web but within the same folder as this page is in</p>
<a href="./3.2_AnotherPage.html">Another Page</a>
<hr>
<h3>Image tags</h3>
<p>Image tags are used to embed images in a page!</p>
