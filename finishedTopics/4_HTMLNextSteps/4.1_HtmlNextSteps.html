  <h1>Next steps in HTML and semantics</h1>
  <h2>Inline versus block elements</h2>
  <p>Inline elements will not require their own line and can be placed 'in line' with other elements on the page</p>
  <p>Block elements will populate their own new line.</p>
  <p>Whether an element is inline or block is predetermined and each element will be one of those two but this can be changed using CSS</p>

  <h2>Div elements: The content division element</h2>
  <p>This is a generic container to hold things and group things together. A div is a block style element.</p>
  <h2>Span</h2>
  <p>Just like the div, a span element is a generic element that can be wrapped around certain content. A span is an <b>inline element</b>. You can use classes to target a span and give it unique styling.</p>
  <h2>An assortment of elements</h2>
  <h3>The horizontal rule (hr) tag</h3>
  <p>This created a line that created a "thematic break" between topics as shown b</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>A break</h3>
  <p>This produces a line break in the html document</p>
  <h3>sup and sub elements</h3>
  <p>This changes the content to and <sup>upper style</sup> content or <sub>lower <sub>style</sub></sub> content. These tags can be nested to create <sup>multiple <sup>levels <sup>of <sup>script</sup></sup></sup></sup></p>
  <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
  <p>These are special codes or sequences that represent very specific character such a copyright symbol &COPY;</p>
  <p>HTML entities are very useful when attempting to type reserved characters in HTML such as the "Less than" or "Greather than" characters</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&lt; is written in html as <b>"&amp;lt&semi;"</b></li>
    <li>&gt; is written in htmls as <b>"&amp;gt&semi;"</b></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Notice that the ampersand and semicolon are also special characters themselves so just to display them the way that they are displayed here could be done by using Entities</p>
  <ul>
    <li>& can be written as <b>"&amp;amp&semi;"</b>which is confusing because it includes an ampersand to encode it.</li>
    <li>; can be written as <b>"&amp;semi&semi;"</b></li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you think about it, just writing this up is like going down a strange rabbit hole.</p>
  <p>Entities can do fun and interesting things like this:</p>

  <h2>Semantic markup</h2>
  <p>Semantic = related to meaning</p>
  <p>Semantic Markup = meaningful markup</p>
  <p>Some websites use a multitude of div elements but these can be overwhelming and non descriptive. newer HTML allows the use of semantically meaningfull elements that function the same way as a div but are more descriptive of what their function should be.</p>
  <p>Some semantically relevant elements that function as a div are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>nav</li>
    <li>header</li>
    <li>footer</li>
    <li>main</li>
    <li>section</li>
    <li>article</li>
    <li>aside</li>
    <li>summary</li>
    <li>...</li>
  </ul>
