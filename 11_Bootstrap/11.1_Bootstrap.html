  <h1>Bootstrap</h1>
  <p>Bootstrap is CSS that someone else has written to be incorporated into our own code. It is a CSS framework. It is one of many frameworks and is used extensively but other frameworks may also exist so it is possible that you will not work with bootstrap in the future. The purpose of this section is to get you comfortable with using frameworks, not so much needing to use bootstrap.</p>

  <h2>What is Bootstrap?</h2>
  <p>Bootstrap is a CSS framework which is a bunch of code written by others that can be used by developers by inserting the components into an app.</p>
  <p>Bootstrap is responsive and offers some very nice pre-styled elements such as buttons, navbars and froms that are very nice to use.</p>

  <h2>The bootstrap Grid system</h2>
  <p>The bootstrap grid system provides classes  called row and col that can be applied depending on the viewport size. Bootstrap has predefined media-queries that can be used.</p>

  <h2>Including bootstrap</h2>
  <p>The bootstrap stylesheet can be added as a link element such as the link element for this document but it requires users to download the stylesheet and add it to the project.</p>
  <p>Using a CDN is probably much easier and can be included with a simple link through a URL. The CDN link was added to this page.</p>
  <p>It is best to add the bootstrap link before your own stylesheet to allow overwriting any bootstrap styles that you want to change.</p>
  <p>Cerctain components such as a collapsable navbar in Bootstrap require some javascipt and can be added to the html file as CDN as well.</p>

  <h2>Container components in Bootstrap</h2>
  <p>Most of what happens in Bootstrap is implemented through classes that are defined in the bootstrap stylesheet.</p>
  <p>A container is the most basic layout element in bootstrap. Containers contain and pad their content that is responsive. An example is included below:</p>
  <div class="container">
    <p>Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Ullam dolore facere quaerat a vel veritatis dicta adipisci iure, nemo minima, molestiae molestias tenetur velit, neque maiores officia doloremque temporibus. Impedit.</p>
  </div>

  <p>You will notice that this page looks oddly different from previous pages. That is because bootstrap is already implementing certain styles just by adding the framework. You may also notice that the container has some predefined padding added to it. Containers already have some predefined breakpoints applied to it.</p>
  <p>Another element is "container-fluid". The example paragraph below is in a container-fluid div</p>

  <div class="container-fluid">
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Neque explicabo aut ut odit, totam voluptate fugit a vitae! In quos eligendi qui eos eius. Omnis, alias! Eaque quidem officia exercitationem.</p>
  </div>
